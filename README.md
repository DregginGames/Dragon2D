# Dragon2D
Dragon2D is a 2D Rpg engine written in D2! (yes i switched there from c++) 


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DregginGames/Dragon2D.svg?branch=dev-0.4)](https://travis-ci.org/DregginGames/Dragon2D)

## Why D
There are many reasons why i decided to use D. One is the safer design of the language making it hard to have things like memory leaks (yay garbage collection). 
Other reasons are the modular design and the readability. However i will cover this sometime in the future in the Dragon2D github wiki.
